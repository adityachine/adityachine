I am currently in my final year of BTech, passionate about all things cybersecurity and startup culture. As the founder of Metainnovix, I am deeply involved in building innovative solutions and expanding my skills in the rapidly evolving world of information security.

My journey in cybersecurity focuses on mastering SOC (Security Operations Center) analysis and incident response. I actively work with Linux distributions like Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and Parrot OS while diving deep into web penetration testing, CTF competitions, and cyber awareness initiatives.

Key Skills:

**SOC Analyst Roadmap:** Currently enhancing my skills in SIEM tools like Splunk and ELK, network traffic analysis, and incident response workflows.

**Offensive Security:** Practical experience in Kali Linux tools, performing web app penetration testing, and simulating cyberattacks.

**Open Source OS:** Deep expertise in Linux, leveraging the power of Ubuntu, Parrot OS, and Kali Linux for cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

**CTF Competitor:** Enthusiastically participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges to hone my skills in real-world threat scenarios.

**Cyber Awareness:** Passionate about promoting security best practices and spreading awareness around common cyber threats.

Iâ€™m excited to network with other cybersecurity professionals, participate in collaborative projects, and continue building my expertise as I prepare for a career in SOC analysis and incident response.
